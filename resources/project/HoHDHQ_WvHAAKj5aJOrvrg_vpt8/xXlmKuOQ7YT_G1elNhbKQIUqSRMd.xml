<Info description="This project focuses on engineering design, simulation, and optimization of mechanical components, using a motorcycle swingarm as a case study. It employs the Partial Differential Equation Toolbox, Global Optimization Toolbox, MATLAB-Python interoperability, and MATLAB App Designer. The project explores engineering design optimization to achieve a lightweight yet robust motorcycle swingarm capable of withstanding typical loading scenarios. It introduces the principles of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and its application in modern engineering design, utilizing the latest features of the Partial Differential Equation Toolbox. Additionally, it demonstrates MATLAB-Python interoperability by using APIs from PythonOCC (https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core) to manipulate the engineering design and assess mechanical endurance, alongside APIs from the Partial Differential Equation Toolbox. The project further includes the use of APIs from the Global Optimization Toolbox and the Optimize Live Task to enhance the component&apos;s strength. The workflow culminates in a comprehensive MATLAB App developed with MATLAB App Designer."/>
